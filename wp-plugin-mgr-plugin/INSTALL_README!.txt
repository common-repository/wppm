HOW TO INSTALL:

Couldn't be easier...

Just copy the file "wp-plugin-mgr.php" (located in "put_into_wp-root") into your Wordpress root folder (this is the directory that contains every Wordpress files and folders, e.g. "index.php", "wp-layout.css" etc)

Once you copied the file, browse to it (by appending "wp-plugin-mgr.php" to your blog URL, e.g. if your blog is at "http://mydomain.com/blog/", go to "http://mydomain.com/blog/wp-plugin-mgr.php").

OPTIONAL:

You can copy "wp-plugin-mgr-plugin.php" into the "plugins" folder (located inside "wp-content").

IF you copy the plugin file ("wp-plugin-mgr-plugin.php") and are using WP 1.3, a new link will appear under the "Options" menu in the Admin menu: clicking this link will take you directly to wp-plugin-mgr...
